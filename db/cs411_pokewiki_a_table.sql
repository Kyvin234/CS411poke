If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon\'s moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.\n\nAbilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move\'s effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.\n\nAn ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon\'s moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon\'s spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.\n\nWhen this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.\n\nThis ability functions identically to teravolt and turboblaze.'),(105,'super-luck','This Pokémon\'s moves have critical hit rates one stage higher than normal.'),(106,'aftermath','When this Pokémon is knocked out by a move that makes contact, the move\'s user takes 1/4 its maximum HP in damage.'),(107,'anticipation','When this Pokémon enters battle, if one of its opponents has a move that is super effective against it, self destruct, explosion, or a one-hit knockout move, all participating trainers are notified.\n\nThe move itself is not revealed; only that there is such a move.  Moves that inflict typeless damage, such as future sight, and moves of variable type, such as hidden power, count as their listed types.  counter, metal burst, mirror coat, and one-hit KO moves to which this Pokémon is immune do not trigger this ability.'),(108,'forewarn','When this Pokémon enters battle, it reveals the move with the highest base power known by any opposing Pokémon to all participating trainers.\n\nIn the event of a tie, one is chosen at random.\n\nMoves without a listed base power are assigned one as follows:\n\nPower | Moves\n----: | -----\n  160 | One-hit KO moves: fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold\n  120 | Counter moves: counter, metal burst, and mirror coat\n   80 | Variable power or set damage: crush grip, dragon rage, electro ball, endeavor, final gambit, flail, frustration, grass knot, gyro ball, heat crash, heavy slam, hidden power, low kick, natural gift, night shade, psywave, return, reversal, seismic toss, sonic boom, trump card, and wring out\n    0 | Any such move not listed\n'),(109,'unaware','This Pokémon ignores other Pokémon\'s stat modifiers for the purposes of damage and accuracy calculation.\n\nEffectively, this affects modifiers of every stat except Speed.\n\nThe power of punishment and stored power is calculated as usual.

If this Pokémon loses its ability before the five turns are up, its Attack and Speed return to normal; if it then regains this ability without leaving battle, its Attack and Speed are halved again, but the counter keeps counting from where it was.'),(113,'scrappy','This Pokémon ignores ghost-type Pokémon\'s immunity to normal- and fighting-type moves.\n\nGhost Pokémon\'s other types affect damage as usual.'),(114,'storm-drain','All other Pokémon\'s single-target water-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon, if it is an eligible target.  Other Pokémon\'s Water moves raise this Pokémon\'s Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.\n\nIf the move\'s intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest Speed stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  follow me takes precedence over this ability.'),(115,'ice-body','This Pokémon heals for 1/16 of its maximum HP after each turn during hail, and it does not take hail damage regardless of type.'),(116,'solid-rock','This Pokémon takes 0.75× as much damage from moves that are super effective against it.\n\nThis ability functions identically to filter.'),(117,'snow-warning','The weather changes to hail when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless cancelled by another weather condition.\n\nIf multiple Pokémon with this ability, drizzle, drought, or sand stream are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of Speed, respecting trick room.  Each ability\'s weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay.'),(118,'honey-gather','This Pokémon has a chance of picking up honey after each battle.  This chance starts at 5% and rises another 5% after every tenth level: 5% from level 1–10, 10% from 11–20, and so on, up to 50% from 91–100.\n\nThis ability is checked after the battle ends, at which point any temporary ability changes have worn off.'),(119,'frisk','Wenn ein Pokémon mit dieser Fähigkeit den Kampf betritt, wird allen Trainern mitgeteilt, welches Item der Gegner hält.\n\nWenn bei Mehrfachkämpfen ein Gegner ein Item hält, wird dieses angezeigt, wenn mehr ein Item halten wird ein zufälliges angekündigt.'),(120,'reckless','This Pokémon\'s recoil moves and crash moves have 1.2× their base power.\n\nstruggle is unaffected.\n\nThe \"crash moves\" are the moves that damage the user upon missing: jump kick and high jump kick.'),(121,'multitype','If this Pokémon is holding an elemental Plate, its type and form change to match the Plate.\n\nThis Pokémon\'s held item, whether or not it is a Plate, cannot be taken by covet or thief, nor removed by knock off, nor traded by switcheroo or trick.  Covet, Thief, and Knock Off still inflict damage against this Pokémon.  Unlike with sticky hold, this Pokémon cannot use fling, Switcheroo, or Trick to lose its item itself, nor gain an item through Switcheroo or Trick if it does not have one.\n\nThis ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than arceus.  This ability cannot be traded with skill swap, nor copied with role play or trace, nor disabled with gastro acid, nor changed with worry seed.  This Pokémon cannot use Skill Swap or Role Play to lose its ability itself.  mold breaker cannot ignore this ability.\n\nIf a Pokémon Transforms into an Arceus with this ability, it will Transform into Arceus\'s default, normal-type form.  If the Transforming Pokémon is holding a Plate, this ability will then activate and change the Pokémon into the corresponding form.'),(122,'flower-gift','Friendly Pokémon have 1.5× their Attack and Special Defense during strong sunlight if any friendly Pokémon has this ability.\n\nUnlike forecast, multitype, and zen mode, this ability is not tied to its Pokémon\'s form change; cherrim will switch between its forms even if it loses this ability.  As such, this ability also works if obtained by a Pokémon other than Cherrim.'),(123,'bad-dreams','Opposing Pokémon take 1/8 of their maximum HP in damage after each turn while they are asleep.'),(124,'pickpocket','Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, if it does not have a held item, it steals the attacker\'s held item.\n\nThis Pokémon cannot steal upon being knocked out.  It can steal if the attacker has a substitute, but cannot steal when its own Substitute is hit.  If a move hits multiple times, only the last hit triggers this ability.  If this Pokémon is wild, it cannot steal from a trained Pokémon.'),(125,'sheer-force','This Pokémon\'s moves with extra effects have 1.3× their power, but lose their extra effects.\n\nAn effect chance is a move\'s chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move\'s main effect. For example, thunder shock\'s paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave\'s is not, nor are knock off\'s item removal and air cutter\'s increased critical hit rate.\n\nMoves that lower the user\'s stats are unaffected.'),(126,'contrary','Whenever this Pokémon\'s stats would be raised, they are instead lowered by the same amount, and vice versa.'),(127,'unnerve','Opposing Pokémon cannot eat held Berries while this Pokémon is in battle.\n\nAffected Pokémon can still use bug bite or pluck to eat a target\'s Berry.'),(128,'defiant','When any of this Pokémon\'s stats are lowered, its Attack rises by two stages.\n\nIf multiple stats are lowered at once, this ability takes effect with each stat lowered.'),(129,'defeatist','This Pokémon\'s Attack and Special Attack are halved when it has half its HP or less.'),(130,'cursed-body','Moves that hit this Pokémon have a 30% chance of being Disabled afterward.'),(131,'healer','Friendly Pokémon next to this Pokémon in double and triple battles each have a 30% chance of being cured of any major status ailment after each turn.'),(132,'friend-guard','All friendly Pokémon take 0.75× as much direct damage from moves while this Pokémon is in battle.\n\nThis effect stacks if multiple allied Pokémon have it.'),(133,'weak-armor','Whenever a physical move hits this Pokémon, its Speed rises one stage and its Defense falls one stage.\n\nThis ability triggers on every hit of a multiple-hit move.'),(134,'heavy-metal','This Pokémon has double the usual weight for its species.'),(135,'light-metal','This Pokémon has half the usual weight for its species.'),(136,'multiscale','This Pokémon takes half as much damage when it is hit having full HP.'),(137,'toxic-boost','This Pokémon has 1.5× its Attack when poisoned.'),(138,'flare-boost','This Pokémon has 1.5× its Special Attack when burned.'),(139,'harvest','After each turn, if the last item this Pokémon consumed was a Berry and it is not currently holding an item, it has a 50% chance of regaining that Berry, or a 100% chance during strong sunlight.'),(140,'telepathy','This Pokémon does not take damage from friendly Pokémon\'s moves, including single-target moves aimed at it.'),(141,'moody','After each turn, one of this Pokémon\'s stats at random rises two stages, and another falls one stage.\n\nIf a stat is already at 6 or -6 stages, it will not be chosen to be increased or decreased, respectively.'),(142,'overcoat','This Pokémon does not take damage from weather.'),(143,'poison-touch','This Pokémon\'s contact moves have a 30% chance of poisoning the target with each hit.\n\nThis counts as an extra effect for the purposes of shield dust.
